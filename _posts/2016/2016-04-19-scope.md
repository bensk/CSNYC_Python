## ‚è≥ Do Now (in notebook)

Rank the following from easiest to hardest:

1. Importing built-in functions
2. Using `randint`
3. Abstraction/creating functions
4. Passing int/str/float/bool parameters into functions
5. Calling a function
6. List syntax
7. Return vs print

We will have a quiz next class covering all of the above topics. Is there any topic you would like to focus on and cover more of? <br><br>

Type the following into the terminal and run the program:

```python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
# input: a list of strings
# output: None
def my_function(list_argument):
	list_argument[0] = 'z'
print my_list
my_function(my_list)
print my_list
```
What happened? Try writing a similar program but passing in integers instead of a list. What happens?

## üìñ Reading

### Variables and parameters are local

When you create a variable inside a function, it is **local**, which means that it only exists inside the function. For example:

```python
global_variable = 'bob'

def fun():
    local_variable = 'bob'

print global_variable #what actually prints?
print local_variable  #what actually prints?
```

Another example:

```python
def together(part1, part2):
    cat = part1 + part2
    print(cat)
```

This function takes two parameters <sup>(`part1` and `part2`)</sup> , adds them, and prints the result twice. Here is an example that uses it:

```python
line1 = 'Hello there, '
line2 = 'children.'
together(line1, line2)
# What prints?
```
When `together` terminates, the variable cat (inside `together()`) is destroyed. What happens if we try to print it?

```python
>>> print(cat)
NameError: name 'cat' is not defined
```

Parameters are also local. For example, outside `together`, there is no such thing as `part1` or `part2`.

### Aliasing

If `a` refers to an object and you assign `b = a`, then both variables refer to the same object:

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
b is a
True
```

### Local, Global, Build-in `LBG`

Python understands names at three **scopes**: `l`ocal, then `g`lobal, then `b`uilt-in.

## üñ• Lab

<span class="mega-octicon octicon-file-code"></span>
<kbd>In PyCharm, create a new file called <mark>Scope_Lab.py</mark></kbd>

### Aliasing

Will updating b affect a? Explain why or why not?

```python
a = [1, 2, 4]
b = a
```

Predict what `my_list` list will print out when this code is run. If you are not sure check the code by copying and running it.

```python
# input: a list of ints
# output: an int
def update_list(a_list):
    a_list[3] = "yo"
    b = a_list[4]
    b = 100
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
update_list(my_list)
print my_list
```

### Scope

Label each variable as global or local.

```python
var_1 = "kittens"
var_2 = "cookies"
# input: a string
# output: a string
def my_function(my_favorite_things):
    song_lyrics = "rain drops on roses,"
    combined_song = song_lyrics + my_favorite_things
    return combined_song
# input: a string
# output: a string
def my_function_2(item, item2):
    full_lyrics = item + "on " + item2
    full_song = my_function(full_lyrics)
    return full_song
my_song = my_function_2(var_1, var_2)
```

**Write down what (if anything) is wrong with the following code. If there was an issue write out how to fix it. If you are unsure copy and run the code and fix it.**

```python
var_1 = 'cat'
var_2 = 'dog'

def print_out_my_favorite(favorite_pet):
    if favorite_pet == var_1:
        print("My favorite pet is the cat.")
    if favorite_pet == var_2:
        print("My favorite pet is the dog.")
    var_2 = "cat"

print_out_my_favorite(var_1)
print(var_2)
```

Write a program that has a global variable, `my_num`. Create three functions that update `my_num`:

1. `add2`: this function adds 2 to `my_num`
2. `multiply_num`: this function takes in a parameter, `multiplier`, and multiplies `my_num` by that parameter
3. `add2_and_multiply`: this function takes in a parameter, `multiplier`, and calls `add2`, then calls `multiply_num`.
