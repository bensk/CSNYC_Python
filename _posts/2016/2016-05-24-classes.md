## Do Now (In the Classroom):
Pick an object in the classroom. Describe it, using as many adjectives as you can.    

> â€œthis ball is round. it is pink. it is big."

---

## Describing Things
Normally, in code, you can describe **ONE** thing at a time. You can make:

```python
size = 10
color = "red"
shape = "round"
```

But what if we want to compare **TWO** things? Well we could always:

```python
ball1size = 10
ball2size = 20
ball1color = red
ball2color = blue
ball1shape = round
ball2shape = round
# Ugh much work
```

But that's complicated, and hard to keep track of. And what if we want to add another ball? Do we need to add 3 **MORE** statements to describe that ball?

What if we could make our own `objects` in code, with `attributes`, just like objects in the real world?

Once we write down that balls have the attributes `size`, `color`, and `shape`, we can just create a `class`, so that we can make new balls easily. These new `balls` come with the attributes already created.

Basically, this makes code easier and less complicated, and lets us treat each `ball` as its own thing, and not as a bunch of separate things with the same sticker on them.

**Take a look at this mess. How would you print out the full name of each pet?**

```python
my_pet_1 = 'pet'
my_pet_1_type = 'direwolf'
my_pet_1_noise = 'howl'
my_pet_1_full_name = 'Ghost'

my_pet_2 = 'pet'
my_pet_2_type = 'direwolf'
my_pet_2_noise = 'howl'
my_pet_2_full_name = 'Nymeria'

my_pet_3 = 'pet'
my_pet_3_type = 'direwolf'
my_pet_3_noise = 'howl'
my_pet_3_full_name = 'Summer'

my_pets = [my_pet_1, my_pet_2, my_pet_3]
for pet in my_pets:
    ## print full name of each pet
```

**Ugh that's terrible**

## Classes
We've seen a bunch of different kind of built-in data in Python: integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, dictionaries...

A `class` is a way to define our own type of data.

```python
class Pet(object):
    """Represents a pet"""

my_pet_1 = Pet()
my_pet_1.type = 'direwolf'
my_pet_1.noise = 'howl'
my_pet_1.full_name = 'Ghost'

my_pet_2 = Pet()
my_pet_2.type = 'direwolf'
my_pet_2.noise = 'howl'
my_pet_2.full_name = 'Nymeria'

my_pet_3 = Pet()
my_pet_3.type = 'direwolf'
my_pet_3.noise = 'howl'
my_pet_3.full_name = 'Summer'

my_pets = [my_pet_1, my_pet_2, my_pet_3]
print type(my_pets)
for pet in my_pets:
    print pet.full_name
```

`my_pet_1`,`my_pet_2`, and `my_pet_3` are all **instances** of the `Pet` **class.** They're have different **attributes**.

## <span class="mega-octicon octicon-mortar-board"></span> Create a Color Class
In this lab we will create a class that will represent colors and build a function to combine two colors.

### How do colors even
RGB is a way of storing color data. R stands for red, G stands for green, and B stands for blue. Each color is given a value from 0 to 255.

You can use this tool to see what different colors are:[http://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.htm](http://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.htm)

| Specification   | Points   |
|---|:---:|
| Create a **class**, `Color`.  | 1 |
| **Instantiate** at least 3 colors. | 1 |
| Add **attributes** of r, g, and b to those instances. | 1 |
| Define a function, `add_color(color1, color2)`, which takes in two colors and returns a color that is the average of the two reds, greens, and blues. | 1 |
| Test your function and see if it accurately returns colors | 1 |
