title: Lesson 3.0 üëâ Lists
---

When you calculated your [average](http://bsk.education/CSNYC_Python/_pages/Lesson1.1/), how many variables did you need?

## ‚úç Datatypes so far...
- **Strings** `‚Äúcharacters in quotes‚Äù`
- **Integers** `42`
- **Floats** `4.2`
- **Booleans** `True or False`
- **Variables** `score = "bob"`
Each datatype is **ONE** piece of information.

## ‚úç Lists
**Datatype** used to store a **collection** of different pieces of information, in order, under a **single** variable name.

```python
numbers = [5, 6, 7, 8]
#  index   0  1  2  3
```

## List Practice

```python
numbers = [5, 6, 7, 8]
#  index   0  1  2  3

# What will print?
do_now = ["words", "stuff", "wrong", "this", "right", "question", "got", "you"]
print do_now[7] + do_now[6] + do_now[3] + do_now[2]
```

- What if we wanted to find the average of an _entire_ class?
- What if we wanted to add another subject?
- What if we don't want to type the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again?
