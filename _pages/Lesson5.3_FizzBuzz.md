- Print the numbers 1 → 100 except...
- For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number
- For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number
- For multiples of 3 & 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number
- Start here:

```python
for groot in range(1,101):
    print groot

# How do you check if a number is divisible by 3?
# (Hint: Would the REMAINDER be?)
```
This is a common interview question for Software Engineering jobs.

Good luck! Iterate!

It should look like this:


	1
	2
	Fizz
	4
	Buzz
	Fizz
	7
	8
	Fizz
	Buzz
	11
	Fizz
	13
	14
	FizzBuzz
