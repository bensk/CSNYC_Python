## üêç Python
A popular & powerful programming language.

```python
# It looks like this:   
print "Hello world!"    
# and you get back    
"Hello world!"    
```

## Beware the `IDEs` (of March)
**IDE** = _Integrated Development Environment_

<div style = "font-size: 10px; text-align: center; color: #ECA241">For those of us that didn't study computer science...</div>

**IDE** = "software for writing software"

I'll recommend a few different solutions, depending on the age of the student's you're working with, your own tech comfort, and the ease with which you can install software on your classroom(s) computers:

| Tool                                                                                      | Good for...                                                      | When to leave it...                    |
