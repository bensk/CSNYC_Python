## ✍ Python Notes
✅ A variables stores **data** and gives it a **name**.    
✅ Two kinds of data are **numbers** and **booleans**.    
✅ In Python, **white space** is used to structure code.     
✅ The **interpreter** runs your code line by line.    
✅ **#** makes a single-line comment in Python.    

### Python Variables
can be    
**Numbers** `myAge = 37`    
or    
**Strings** `myName= "Ben"`    
or    
**Booleans** `isItSaturday = False`

### Whitespace

```python
def spam():
    eggs = 12
    return eggs

print spam()

# Spaces & tabs structure code
```
