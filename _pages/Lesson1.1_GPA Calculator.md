## ‚è≥ A <sub>little</sub> Review
Python understands data in the form of _____, _____, and _____.

Use your IDE of choice to find out what these do, noting the effect in `#comments`.

```python
print len("strings!")
print "strings".lower()
print "strings".upper()
print "strings".capitalize()
print str("strings!")
print type("Hello there, children.")
```

**What's wrong with this code?**

```python
print "The meaning of life is" + 42
# How can we fix it?
```

## GPA Calculator
In this assignment, you're going to create an app to calculate your GPA. The code will look something like this:
```python
# variable = input("question?")
math = input("What's your grade in math?")
# What happens if you try this?
```
- [ ] How many inputs do you need?
- [ ] What kind of data do you get back from an input?

_Try this to find out a type of data:_

```python
  print type(input("What's your grade in math?"))
```
